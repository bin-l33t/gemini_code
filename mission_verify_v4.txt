OBJECTIVE: Verify if "Agent_v4" is successfully running on Port 8080.

Step 1: Process Check
Check if the python process is running.
Command: ps aux | grep gemini_server_v4.py

Step 2: Port Check
Check if Port 8080 is currently being listened to.
Command: lsof -i :8080

Step 3: Identity Verification
Perform a curl request to the local server to verify the Agent's name in the HTML response.
Command: curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep "Agent_v4"

Step 4: Report
If the process is running, the port is open, and "Agent_v4" is found in the HTML, report "SUCCESS: Generation 4 is active." Otherwise, report failure details.
