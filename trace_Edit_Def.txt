- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.`:""}
- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the ${K9} tool.
- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.
- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.`});var f3="Edit",LrA="/.claude/**",OrA="~/.claude/**",iwA="File has been unexpectedly modified.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the ${C3} tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
