Verify the integrity of the swarm_workspace. First, read the contents of swarm_workspace/swarm_monitor.py and swarm_workspace/tests/test_swarm_core.py to ensure they contain the full scripts from swarm-p.txt. If they are correct, execute the command python3 -m unittest swarm_workspace/tests/test_swarm_core.py and report the specific output of the four tests. Finally, confirm if gemini_server_v9.py now includes explicit logging for tool results in the history_log.
