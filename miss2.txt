MISSION: Rectify Workspace Initialization and Verify Architecture

File Restoration: Read the full script contents for swarm_monitor.py and tests/test_swarm_core.py from swarm-p.txt. Overwrite the current placeholder files in swarm_workspace/ with this complete code.

Persona Setup: Ensure swarm_workspace/personas/agent_engineer.md is correctly populated. If it is empty or incorrect, copy the content from the existing gemini_swarm/personas/agent_engineer.md.

Test Execution: Execute the test suite by running python3 -m unittest swarm_workspace/tests/test_swarm_core.py. Report the final status of all four tests (Bash tool, Edit tool, InspectPort, and Core initialization).

Logging Audit: Inspect gemini_server_v9.py. Confirm whether the code now includes explicit logic to record the results of tool executions (such as stdout or EXIT_CODE) into the history_log structure.
