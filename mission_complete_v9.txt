"Complete the implementation of auto_test_agent_v9.py.

Implement the discovery_mode(self, command) method: it should parse the command for potential filenames, run a bash find . -name <filename> to locate them, and update the StateManifest with the corrected path.

Add a run(self, mission) method. This method must include a loop that:

Calls the Gemini model (gemini-3-pro).

Enforces the 'Thought Protocol' by ensuring a Thought object is parsed and recorded.

Executes tools and feeds the observation back to the model.

Implements a 'max_iterations' safety break and an 'early stopping' check if the Verification Gate passes.

Integrate the toolset from gemini_swarm.tools into the class for easy invocation.

Update the if __name__ == "__main__": block to handle command-line mission input."
