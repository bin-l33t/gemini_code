OBJECTIVE: Clear port 8888 and spawn a sub-agent to deploy a new server.

STEP 1: CHECK & CLEAN PORT 8888
Check if any process is currently listening on port 8888 (using lsof, netstat, or ss).
If a process is found, identify its PID and kill it immediately to free the port. Verify the port is free before proceeding.

STEP 2: PREPARE RECURSIVE MISSION
Create a new file named 'inner_mission.txt' containing the following instructions for a distinct agent:
"""
1. Create a directory '~/gemini_code_test' if it doesn't exist.
2. Inside that directory, write a Python script 'server.py' that runs a simple HTTP server on port 8888.
3. Start the server using 'nohup python3 server.py > server.log 2>&1 &'.
   IMPORTANT: You MUST run it in the background with nohup so the command returns immediately and does not hang the agent.
4. Verify the server is running by checking the 'server.log' or using 'curl' on localhost:8888.
"""

STEP 3: EXECUTE RECURSIVE AGENT
Run a new instance of the agent using the current script 'auto_test_agent_v4.py'.
Pass 'inner_mission.txt' as the prompt file argument.
Ensure you capture the output of this sub-agent to confirm it successfully deployed the server.
