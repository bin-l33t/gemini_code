OBJECTIVE: Fix the deployment script to persist the server in the background and verify it remains active.

Phase 1: Fix Deployment Script
The previous deployment failed because the server ran in the foreground, causing the agent to time out and kill it.
1. Edit `evolve_agent.sh` to run the server in the background using `nohup` and detach it.
   New Content:
   #!/bin/bash
   nohup python3 gemini_server_v4.py --name "Agent_v4" --port 8080 --force > server_v4.log 2>&1 &
   echo "Server launched in background. PID: $!"

Phase 2: Execution
1. Ensure the script is executable (`chmod +x evolve_agent.sh`).
2. Run `./evolve_agent.sh`.

Phase 3: Verification
1. Wait 5 seconds to ensure startup stabilizes.
2. Check if the process is still running: `ps aux | grep gemini_server_v4.py`
3. Verify the server is responding: `curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep "Agent_v4"`
4. Check the logs for successful binding: `cat server_v4.log`

If the process is listed and curl returns the agent name, report SUCCESS.
