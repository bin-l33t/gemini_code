**Context:** The user reported that number inputs aren't working correctly in the calculator. I've identified the `handleInput()` function as the likely source, but need to understand what values are being processed.

**Your Task:** In `calculator.js`, inside the `handleInput()` function, add 2-3 `console.log` statements after the `TODO(human)` comment to help debug why number inputs fail.

**Guidance:** Consider logging: the raw input value, the parsed result, and any validation state. This will help us understand where the conversion breaks.
