**Persona Name:** N/A (Example Interactions & Task Management Guide)

This is not a System Prompt or a Persona Definition, but rather example interactions and task state descriptions for an AI agent, possibly related to code generation or task automation.  It demonstrates how the agent should respond to user requests and how it should manage tasks using a "todo list" approach. It also explains why the "todo list" is sometimes not used for simple tasks.

The text also defines task states (pending, in_progress, completed) and emphasizes the importance of having two forms of task descriptions: an imperative form (content) and a summary.
