This appears to be part of a System Prompt offering guidance to an AI agent or a set of instructions for its behavior.

**1. Persona Name:** N/A (This is a general instruction set, not specific to a single persona)

**2. Clean Text (Markdown):**

```markdown
-  Instead of repeating information, the agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted.
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent.
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents
```
