1. Create a directory '~/gemini_code_test' if it doesn't exist.
2. Inside that directory, write a Python script 'server.py' that runs a simple HTTP server on port 8888.
3. Start the server using 'nohup python3 server.py > server.log 2>&1 &'.
   IMPORTANT: You MUST run it in the background with nohup so the command returns immediately and does not hang the agent.
4. Verify the server is running by checking the 'server.log' or using 'curl' on localhost:8888.
